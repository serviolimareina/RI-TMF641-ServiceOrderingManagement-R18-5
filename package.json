  "description": "## TMF API Reference : TMF 641 - Service Ordering Management  ## Release : 18.5 - Dec 2018  The Service Order API provides a standardized mechanism for managing Service Order, a type of order which can be used to place an order between a customer and a service provider or between a service provider and a partner and vice versa.  ### Service Order resource A service order will describe a list of service order items.  A service order item references an action on an existing  or  future  service.  By  service  we  designed  Customer Facing  Service  (CFS)  as  well  as  Resource Facing Service (RFS). From a component perspective, a service order should be available - from a Service Orchestration Component (and it could mix CFS and RFS) - from an Infrastructure Control & Management component (and it would have only RFS)  ### Service Order API performs the following operations on service order : - Retrieval of a service order or a collection of service orders depending on filter criteria - Partial update of a service order (including updating rules) - Creation of a service order (including default values and creation rules) - Deletion of service order (for administration purposes) - Notification of events on Service order  Copyright Â© TM Forum 2018.
